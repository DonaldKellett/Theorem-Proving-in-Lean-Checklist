# Theorem-Proving-in-Lean-Checklist

Unofficial checklist of my progress through [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/)

## Why a checklist? Why not a collection of solutions?

So as not to spoil the exercises for others trying to learn Lean through "Theorem Proving in Lean".
